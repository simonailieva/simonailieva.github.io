    <h3><i>Dubai</i></h3>
    <p>For us and many of our travelers, <b>Dubai</b> meant only one thing: a stopover. A place where we land, buy something and look to take off as soon as possible. We didn't think Dubai was a good fit for our story, but about a year ago we spontaneously decided to get off our plane and see what this city had to offer.

We get to know <b>Marrakech</b> - <i>the capital</i> of three Berber and three Arab dynasties, with countless markets, the Katoubia Mosque, Jemaa el Fna - a square square in North Africa and numerous other famous ones.
